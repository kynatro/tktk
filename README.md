# TKTK

_Tktk_ short for ["To Come"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_come_(publishing)) in publishing is a simple placeholder highlighting library. Load this file on your latest project to highlight all the areas that still need copy, links, or final imagery. To highlight items, simply do one of the following:

**Images:** Either add a `tktk` class to the `img` tag or add `#tktk` to the image source.

**Copy:** Either add a `tktk` class to the element, or start the copy with "tktk"

For all elements that are "to come", copy will be highlighted in a nice, obvious `magenta` and images bordered in a 2px `magenta` border (using `box-shadow` so as not to affect layout).
